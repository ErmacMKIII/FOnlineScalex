# FOnlineScalex
FOnline Pixel Art Scalex adapted to FRM formats

FOnlineScalex performs pixel algorithm to FRM files or PNG files with selected files and chosen algorithm by end user.
Selected files can be searched inside directories recursively if user specified that option.
User can also specify precision (as difference tolerance).

One can notice that this program has graphical interface similar to FonlineDatRipper(https://github.com/ErmacMKIII/FOnlineDatRipper) and FO2_HIGHLIGHTHER (https://github.com/ErmacMKIII/FO2_HIGHLIGHTHER).
Just like those mentioned apps Dark Mode is used as part of Graphical User Interface (GUI).
